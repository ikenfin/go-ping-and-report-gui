# Go ping & report GUI

Simple Golang program with GUI, based on @therecipe/qt binding.

UI created using QT Designer.

I created this only for learning purposes, so basically it is not very useful. But maybe the code itself will help someone deal with golang qt bindings.

This "tool" will ping multiple urls in parallel and build some kind of report. 

You can save it as CSV file.

Also you can save reports to CSV file.
